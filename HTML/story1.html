				<h2>The Longest Walk</h2>
				<p>“If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?” he asked.</p> 
				<p>“I would travel as far as my feet can walk. To the edge of the world!” I replied.</p>
				<p>But life can be a paradox. It opens its doors on the days you wanted to hide and closes on the days you wanted to be free. The world shifted into scenes I only thought existed in movies. A virus creeping out and trapping its victim to its last breath. Bustling crowds fading and places are frozen in time. Every day felt the same, stretching to who knows when. But today was different</p>
				<p>I grabbed a small sanitizer and wore my mask like it was already a part of my skin. I felt the sun waking me up as I stepped out of my house. I passed by the elementary school I used to go to. I smiled as the rusty slide reminded me of the time someone threw a rock on my head while I was going down. I fell and cried my way home. I walked to a nearby store and searched for my wallet. I reached in the deepest parts of my pocket but found nothing. The woman stared at me as if she had seen a ghost so I walked away as if nothing happened. I decided to walk around since I already got this far. Three blocks after and I’ve reached our plaza. The spontaneous picnics, high school dance practices, and hangouts we had in this place were endless. I glimpsed at our church from afar and wondered if I would get married there someday. I can already see myself in a white dress, my mother and father bawling their eyes out, while my future husband handsomely stood by the altar. Sighing, I cut myself off from daydreaming and walked home. The sky was divided in orange and blue like a battle of fire and water. When I reached home, I saw my mother cooking for dinner. I watched her silently and admire how can she raise four headstrong girls while my father is away at work for months. I barged into my sister’s room and saw the youngest busy scribbling the walls and the other two were watching the same movie for the millionth time. My day would never be boring with these three. I went into my room and saw my wallet on top of my college I.D. card. It seems like it was only yesterday that we were cramming for exams when our Professor announced a two-week break that lasted for months. I am trapped within the same walls again but never did I once felt that I was alone. My family is safe and that’s all that matters.</p>
				<p>It felt like the longest walk I had in my entire life. Perhaps, it was my last. Before that day, a lot of things happened so quickly. I was drowning and breathing. I was holding on and the next day I knew, I was letting go</p>
				<p>“If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?” he asked again.</p>
				<p>“I had traveled in places with the people I loved. I had traveled back in time through memories. I think that’s enough for me.” I replied.</p>
				<p>And then, he reached out his hand and I smiled.</p>
				<p>“It’s time for me to rest now.”</p>
